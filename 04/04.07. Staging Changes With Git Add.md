# 7. Staging Changes With Git Add

## Working Directory

A working directory contains both tracked and untracked files.

## Staging Area

The staging area is the middle ground between what you have done to your files (also known as the working directory) and what you had last committed (the HEAD commit)

## Repository

A Git repository is the . git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the . git/ folder, then you delete your project's history

## `git add`
