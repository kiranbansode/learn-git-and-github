# 10. Deleting & Renaming Branches

## `git branch -d <branch-name>` `git branch --delete <branch-name>`

Before deleting branch, make sure branch is merged. Otherwise it will not work

## `git branch -d <branch-name>`

If you still want to delete branch without merging use capital `-D` instead of `-d`.

## `git branch -m <branch-name>`

Use above command to rename git branch
