# 4. Viewing Unstaged Changes

## `gid diff HEAD`

`git diff HEAD` lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit.

## `git diff --staged` or `git diff --cached`

`git diff --stages` or `--cached` will list the changes between the staging area and out last commit.

## `git diff HEAD <filename>` or `git diff --staged <filename>`

We can view the changes withing a specific file by providing git diff with a filename

## `git diff branch1..branch2`

`git diff branch1..branch2` will list the changes between the tips of branch1 and branch2

## `git diff commit1..commit2`

To compare two commits, provide git diff with the commit hashes of the commits in question
